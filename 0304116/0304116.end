\@doendnote{endnote12}{In this paper we will ignore the Gibbs factor $1/N!$. The reader should note also that we are assuming the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics for the particles.}
\@doendnote{endnote13}{Although this factor can be computed by using a regularization prescription, here this factor is absorved as a normalization constant.}
\@doendnote{endnote14}{The component of the antisymmetric density tensor $\epsilon ^{ab}$ are defined as $+1$ if $a>b$.}
