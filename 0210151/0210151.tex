\section{Introduction}

At present, Abelian duality is a classical theme in (quantum)
field theory. In four-dimensional case, there are two well-known
papers on electric-magnetic (or $S$-duality) in Abelian gauge
theory, viz.\ [\ref{B01},\ref{B02}]. In three dimensions, one could
cite the other two papers, [\ref{B03}] and [\ref{B04}], but
unfortunately, neither is fully comprehensive nor satisfactory.
The first ([\ref{B03}]) lacks explicit formulas for the partition
functions and, in a sense, is purely "classical", whereas the
second one ([\ref{B04}]) lacks sufficient generality and
topological aspects are there largely ignored. Moreover, the both
are seemingly contradictory: [\ref{B03}] explicitly shows duality
between Abelian gauge field and scalar field, whereas the
corresponding partition functions calculated in [\ref{B04}]
markedly differ.

The aim of this short work is to fill the gap and
clarify some points (the reader is advised to consult the above-mentioned papers for more
details which are not repeated here).
In particular, we will explicitly calculate the both partition functions and discuss their mutual duality.

\section{Partition function of the Abelian theory}

We consider the connected, orientable three-dimensional Riemannian (of
Euclidean signature) manifold $\mathcal{M}^{3}$ with torsionless
(co)homology throughout. The action of $U(1)$ gauge theory is
defined by
\begin{equation}\label{T1}
S[A]= \frac{1}{4 \pi e^{2}}\int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}}\; F_{A}\wedge \ast F_{A}
=\frac{1}{8\pi e^{2}} \int_{\mathcal{M}^3}d^{3}x \sqrt{g}\;
F_{ij}F^{ij},\;\;\;\;           i, j= 1, 2, 3,
\end{equation}
where $F_{ij}=\partial_{i}A_{j}-\partial_{j}A_{i} \; (F_{A}=dA)$, $e$ is the coupling constant $(e>0)$, and $g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor.
A standard form of the partition function is
\begin{equation}\label{T2}
Z_{U(1)}=\int\mathcal{D}A\; e^{- S[A]},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{D}A$ denotes a formal integration measure with respect to gauge non-equivalent field configurations, i.e.\ the
Faddeev--Popov procedure is applied.

The partition function consists of several factors:
(1) $Z_{\rm det}$---product of determinants,
(2) $Z_{\rm class}$---sum over the classical saddle points,
(3) $Z_{\rm vol}$---the volume of the space of classical minima,
(4) $Z_{0}$---the contribution from zero modes.

The form of $Z_{\rm det}$, coming from Gaussian integration with respect to gauge fields and ghosts,
is rather standard, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{T3}
Z_{\rm det}=\frac{\rm det^{'}\Delta_{0} }
{(\rm det^{'}\Delta_{1})^\frac{1}{2}},
\end{equation}
where the prime denotes removal of zero modes,
$\Delta_{0}$ is a Laplacian acting on zero-forms
(Faddeev--Popov ghosts), and $\Delta_{1}$ is a Laplacian acting on
one-forms (gauge fields). Obviously, $Z_{\rm det}$ is independent of the
coupling constant $e^2$ and it corresponds to "quantum fluctuations".

The classical part represents the sum over classical saddle
points,
\begin{equation}\label{T4}
Z_{\rm class}=\sum e^{-S[A_{\rm class}]},
\end{equation}
where $A_{\rm class}$ are local minima of the action (1)
corresponding to different line bundles. For non-trivial second
homology of $\mathcal{M}^{3}$ we have field configurations with
non-zero flux,
\begin{equation}\label{T5}
\int_{\Sigma_{I}}F = 2 \pi m^{I}, \;\;\; m^{I} \in \mathbb{Z},
\end{equation}
with $I= 1,...,b_{2}={\rm dim} H_{2}(\mathcal{M}^{3})$. Then the
solutions of the field equations can be represented by the sum
\begin{equation}\label{T6}
F=2 \pi \sum_{ I } m^{ I } \omega_{ I },
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{I}$ span an integral basis of harmonic two-forms
with normalization
\begin{equation}\label{T7}
\int_{\Sigma_{ I}} \omega_{J}=\delta_{J}^{I}.
\end{equation}
Inserting the expansion \eqref{T6} into the partition function \eqref{T4} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{T8}
Z_{\rm class}=\sum_{m^{I}} e^{- S[m^{I}]},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{T9}
S[m^{I}]=\frac{\pi}{e^{2}} \sum_{I,J} G_{IJ} m^{I} m^{J},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{T10}
G_{IJ}=\frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}} d^{3}x
\sqrt{g}\; \omega_{Iij}\omega_{J}^{ij}.
\end{equation}

The volume of the space of classical minima is a torus of dimension
$b_{1}(\mathcal{M}^{3})$ [\ref{B01}], that is,
in our case,
\begin{equation}\label{T11}
Z_{\rm vol}={\rm vol}(T^{b_{1}})=(2\pi)^{b_{1}}.
\end{equation}

Finally, the contribution from zero modes is
\begin{equation}
(2\pi e)^{b_{0}-b_{1}}=(2\pi e)^{1-b_{1}},
\end{equation}
where $b_{0}$ corresponds to Faddeev--Popov ghosts, whereas $b_{1}$ is related to Abelian gauge fields.
Actually, we should divide this by $2\pi$ to obtain an agreement
with "a direct calculation" of the path integral (this is
explicitly demonstrated by considering a simple finite-dimensional
example in Appendix of [\ref{B05}]).
Thus,
\begin{equation}\label{T12}
Z_{0}=\frac{1}{2\pi}(2\pi e)^{1-b_{1}}.
\end{equation}

Collecting all the above terms, i.e. Eq.\eqref{T3}, Eq.\eqref{T8}, Eq.\eqref{T11} and Eq.\eqref{T12}, we obtain an
explicit form of the partition function for three-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory,
\begin{equation}\label{T13}
Z_{ U(1) }= e^{1 - b_1 } \frac{ \rm det^{'} \Delta_{0} }
{(\rm det^{'}\Delta_{1})^\frac{1}{2} } \sum_{m^ {I} } e^{-S[m^{ I }] },
\end{equation}
with $S[m^{I}]$ defined by Eq.\eqref{T9}.

\section{Partition function of the scalar theory}

In this section we will calculate the partition function of the
three-dimensional (single-component) scalar field theory on
$\mathcal{M}^{3}$. In principle, we have the two possibilities: we
could consider ordinary scalar field assuming values in
$\mathbb{R}$ or we could analyze circle-valued scalar field with values in $S$.
A short reflection suggests the second possibility. First of all, for
ordinary scalar field we would not have a chance to reproduce the
reach topological sector of the form \eqref{T8}, \eqref{T9}. Besides, in [\ref{B03}]
Witten has shown duality between the Abelian theory and circle-valued
scalar theory. Anyway, real-valued theory can be considered as a
topologically trivial sector in circle-valued one.

The action of the scalar theory is of the form
\begin{equation}\label{T14}
S[\phi]= \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi}\int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}}\; E_{\phi}\wedge \ast E_{\phi}
=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi} \int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}} d^{3}x \sqrt{g}\; E_{i} E^{i},
\end{equation}
where $E_{i}=\partial_{i} \phi \; (E_{\phi}=d \phi)$, with $\phi \in [0,2\pi)$. The
rest of the notation is analogous to the one used in the previous
section. The partition function for the scalar theory,
\begin{equation}\label{T15}
Z_{\phi}=\int D\phi \; e^{-S[\phi]},
\end{equation}
can be calculated according to the scheme proposed for $Z_{U(1)}$.

The determinantal part consists of only one determinant coming from non-zero modes of scalar field,
\begin{equation}\label{T16}
Z_{\rm det}=(\rm det^{'}\Delta_{0})^{-\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}

As far as the classical part is concerned we can rewrite Eq.\eqref{T4} for $\phi$ field,
\begin{equation}\label{T17}
Z_{\rm class}=\sum e^{-S[\phi_{\rm class}]},
\end{equation}
where, analogously, the sum is taken over the classical saddle points.
But this time, for non-trivial first homology of $\mathcal{M}^{3}$ we have field configurations
with non-zero circulation
\begin{equation}\label{T18}
\int_{C_{I}} E,
\end{equation}
with $I=1,...,b_{1}=$dim$H_{1}(\mathcal{M}^{3})$. Since for
orientable three-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M}^{3}$ we have
$b_{1}=b_{2}$, we assume the same type of indices for $\Sigma$ and
$C$ (see Eq.\eqref{T5}). Then the solution of the field equations
can be expressed by the sum
\begin{equation}\label{T19}
E=2\pi\sum_{I} n^{I}\alpha_{I},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{I}$  span a basis of harmonic
one-forms. The issue of normalization of $\alpha_{I}$ is postponed to the next section.
Inserting the expansion \eqref{T19} into the partition function
\eqref{T17} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{T21}
Z_{\rm class}=\sum_{n^{I}} e^{-\widetilde{S}[n^{ I }]},
\end{equation}
where this time
\begin{equation}\label{T22}
\widetilde{S} [n^{I}] = \pi e^{2} \sum_{I,J} H_{IJ} n^{I}n^{J},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{T23}
H_{IJ}=\int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}} d^{3}x
\sqrt{g} \; \alpha_{Ii}\alpha_{J}^{i},
\end{equation}

The volume of the space of classical minima which is the target
space for this model (the circle $S$) is
\begin{equation}\label{T24}
Z_{\rm vol}={\rm vol} (S) = 2\pi,
\end{equation}
and the zero-mode contribution (from a single zero mode of scalar field)
\begin{equation}\label{T25}
Z_{0}=\frac{e}{2\pi}.
\end{equation}

The final shape of the partition function as the product of
Eq.\eqref{T16}, Eq.\eqref{T21}, Eq.\eqref{T24}, and Eq.\eqref{T25}
assumes the form
\begin{equation}\label{T26}
Z_{\phi}=e \; \frac{1}{ (\rm det^{'}\Delta_{0})^{ \frac{1}{2} }}
\sum_{n^{I} } e^{-\widetilde{S}[n^{I}]},
\end{equation}
with $\widetilde{S}[n^{I}]$ defined by Eq.\eqref{T22}.

\section{Duality and final discussion}

Since we hope for duality, at least in some limited sense, of $U(1)$ gauge
theory and circle-valued scalar field theory, we could expect
exact duality of classical parts of the partition functions,
Eq.\eqref{T8} and Eq.\eqref{T17}. The classical duality takes place if the metric
$G_{IJ}$ on the space of second cohomology and the metric $H_{IJ}$
on the space of first cohomology are equal,
\begin{equation}\label{T27}
G_{IJ}=H_{IJ}.
\end{equation}
The equality \eqref{T27} follows from the duality in de Rham cohomology, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{T28} G_{IJ}&=(\omega_{I}, \omega_{J})=
\int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}} \omega_{I} \wedge \ast\; \omega_{J}=
\int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}}
\omega_{I} \wedge \alpha_{J}\\
&= \int_{\mathcal{M}^{3}} \ast \; \alpha_{I} \wedge \alpha_{J}=
(\alpha_{I}, \alpha_{J})=H_{IJ},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where by definition
\begin{equation}\label{T29}
\alpha_{I} = \ast \; \omega_{I}.
\end{equation}
Eq.\eqref{T29} imposes the lacking normalization condition for
one-forms $\alpha_{I}$, announced after Eq.\eqref{T19}, and crucial
for Eq.\eqref{T27}. This way, the both "classical parts" are
exactly dual in the sense of "$e^{2}$ goes to $1/{e^{2}}$"
equivalence.

The "quantum parts" are definitely different. As far as the
determinants are concerned, the possible equality of Eq.\eqref{T3}
and Eq.\eqref{T16} would imply
\begin{equation}\label{T30}
\frac{\rm det^{'} \Delta_{0} }
{(\rm det^{'}\Delta_{1})^\frac{1}{2} }\;
\frac{1}{ (\rm det^{'}\Delta_{0})^{- \frac{1}{2} }}=1.
\end{equation}
But the LHS of Eq.\eqref{T30} is exactly the inverse of the
Ray--Singer analytic torsion [\ref{B06}] which is not equal to 1,
in general. On the other hand treating the LHS of Eq.\eqref{T30}
as a formal ratio of volumes of spaces of forms [\ref{B07}] gives
1, which is in  accordance with the RHS of Eq.\eqref{T30}, and is in favor of duality. Then
analytic torsion following from (zeta) regularization of
determinants can be considered as a "volume ratio anomaly".

Another kind of regularization yields different powers of the
coupling constant $e$ in front of the both partition functions.
More precisely, the regularized partition function \eqref{T2} of $U(1)$ gauge theory should read
\begin{equation}\label{T31}
Z_{U(1)}(e) = (2 \pi e)^{B_{0}-B_{1}}\; \int\mathcal{D}A\; e^{- S[A]},
\end{equation}
whereas the partition function \eqref{T15} of $S$-valued scalar theory is of the form
\begin{equation}\label{T32}
Z_{\phi} (e) =\left(\frac{e}{2 \pi}\right)^{B_{0}}\; \int D\phi \; e^{-S[\phi]},
\end{equation}
where $B_{k}$ is the (infinite) dimension of the space of $k$-forms on $\mathcal{M}^{3}$.
Upon procedure described earlier we obtain the desired explicit forms of the partition functions, Eq.\eqref{T12} and
Eq.\eqref{T25}.

One could easily generalize our considerations to the case of
Abelian $U(1)^{n}$ gauge theory. The dual scalar model would
assume values in $n$-dimensional torus $T^{n}$, or we could speak
on (linear) $\sigma$-model with target space $T^{n}$. Obviously,
the whole analysis would be analogous to the above one.
