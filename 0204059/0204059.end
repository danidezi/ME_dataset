\@doendnote{endnote22}{This idea is similar to that of MacDowell-Mansouri \cite {MM,Mansouri} in which general relativity is obtained by breaking the $SO(3,2)$ symmetry of a topological field theory down to $SO(3,1)$. The earlier work to present general relativity as a constrained topological field theory can also be seen in\cite {Plebanski}}
\@doendnote{endnote23}{The upper-case Latin letters $A,B,...=0,1$ denote two component spinor indices, which are raised and lowered with the constant symplectic spinors $\epsilon _{AB}=-\epsilon _{BA}$ together with its inverse and their conjugates according to the conventions $\epsilon _{01}=\epsilon ^{01}=+1$, $\lambda ^A:=\epsilon ^{AB}\lambda _B$, $\mu _B:=\mu ^A\epsilon _{AB}$ \cite {PR}.}
\@doendnote{endnote24}{The formulation can be written with purely unprimed spinors by defining spinor 1-forms $\varphi ^A=e^{A0'}$ and $\chi ^A=e^{A1'}$ \cite {TJ}. In terms of these spinor 1-forms, the purely unprimed $sl(2,C)$-valued generalized connection 1-form is ${\protect \cal  A}^+=\left (\omega ^{AB}, \protect \nobreakspace  {}\protect \nobreakspace  {}(2 / l^2)\protect \nobreakspace  {} \chi ^{(A} \wedge \varphi ^{B)} \right ) M_{AB}$ .}
