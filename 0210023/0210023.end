\@doendnote{endnote21}{We no longer include the discrete symmetry $Z_2$: $\psi ^1_k(x)\mathrel {\mathop {\protect \longleftrightarrow  }\limits ^{Z_2}}\psi ^2_k(x), \ \ {\protect \rm  if} \ \psi _k(x)=\left (\psi ^1_k(x),\psi ^2_k(x) \right )$, as was stated in Ref.\cite {kn:16}, since the kinetic energy terms in Eq. (1.1) actually have not separate $Z_2$ symmetry.}
