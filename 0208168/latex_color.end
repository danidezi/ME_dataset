\@doendnote{endnote22}{In Ref. \cite {requardt} a similar argument was considered to establish rigorously the validity of Derrick's theorem for infinite systems. That study showed, in particular, that when augmented with the additional condition of finite energy, surface terms like the one in Eq.\protect \nobreakspace  {}(\ref {first_cond}) vanish in the infinite-volume limit, proving thus the validity of the theorem for unbounded systems.}
